Hovercraft is an implementation of heightmapped (and quadtree/frustum-culled) terrain, with various bits added to make it more interesting. It has linear and angular physics modelling for the hovercraft, as well as procedural sky, stencil shadows, and a simplistic particle system for dust trails. It uses Direct3D9 with v2.0 pixel shaders, so requires dx9-class hardware to run.
